# PIT Transcriptor

Transcriptor is a community funded project designed to make podcasting more accessible through better transcriptions.

## Focus:

While this application could (and will) be used for all kinds of audio content, my design focus is on improving content around developer podcasts.

Transcription services have a terrible time with jargon related to technical content. While this can usually be interpreted by some developers it can make learning through podcast content difficult for many others. Our goal is to use diferentials in transcription edits to create custom dictionaries.


## Contributing:

At the moment contributions are limited as the time available to work on this project is also limited. As we focus more on Transcriptor, we will accept contributions from the community on a case-by-case basis.

That said the tool is open-source under the MIT License so you are free to duplicate and improve the code.
